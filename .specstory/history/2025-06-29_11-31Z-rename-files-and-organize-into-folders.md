# Rename files and organize into folders (2025-06-29 11:31Z)

_**User**_

Change file names and class names to RGLight and also create a folder inside each such as screens with name of RGLight and put that all files there.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to:

1. Change file names and class names to "RGLight"
2. Create a folder inside each such as screens with name of "RGLight" 
3. Put all the files there

Looking at the project structure, it seems like this is a Flutter project for a "Red Light Green Light" game (from Squid Game). The user wants to rename files and classes to use "RGLight" (probably short for Red Green Light) and organize them into RGLight folders.

Let me first understand the current structure by looking at the relevant files to see what needs to be renamed:

1. In `lib/game/` there's `red_light_green_light_game.dart`
2. In `lib/screens/` there are several screen files
3. Other related files that might need renaming

Let me start by examining the current files to understand the structure and what classes/files need to be renamed.</details></think>

---

I'll help you reorganize the project structure by renaming files and classes to "RGLight" and creating proper folder organization. Let me start by examining the current structure to understand what needs to be changed.

Read file: lib/game/red_light_green_light_game.dart

| 📄 `start_screen.dart` |

</details>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I understand the current structure. I need to:

1. Rename the main game class from `RedLightGreenLightGame` to `RGLightGame`
2. Rename the file from `red_light_green_light_game.dart` to `rg_light_game.dart`
3. Create an `RGLight` folder inside the `screens` directory
4. Move all screen files into the new `lib/screens/RGLight/` folder
5. Create an `RGLight` folder inside the `game` directory  
6. Move the game files into the new `lib/game/RGLight/` folder
7. Update all imports accordingly

Let me also check some of the other files to see what other classes might need renaming.</details></think>

| 📄 `game_controller.dart` |

</details>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have a clear picture of what needs to be done. Let me plan the reorganization:

1. **Create new folder structure:**
   - `lib/screens/RGLight/` - for screen files
   - `lib/game/RGLight/` - for game files

2. **Rename and move files:**
   - `lib/game/red_light_green_light_game.dart` → `lib/game/RGLight/rg_light_game.dart`
   - `lib/game/game_controller.dart` → `lib/game/RGLight/game_controller.dart`
   - `lib/screens/start_screen.dart` → `lib/screens/RGLight/start_screen.dart`
   - `lib/screens/game_over_screen.dart` → `lib/screens/RGLight/game_over_screen.dart`
   - `lib/screens/win_screen.dart` → `lib/screens/RGLight/win_screen.dart`
   - `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart` → `lib/screens/RGLight/splash_screen.dart`

3. **Rename classes:**
   - `RedLightGreenLightGame` → `RGLightGame`
   - `_RedLightGreenLightGameState` → `_RGLightGameState`

4. **Update imports** in all affected files

Let me start by creating the new folder structure and then moving and renaming the files.</details></think>

---

Now I'll reorganize your project structure by creating RGLight folders and renaming files and classes. Let me start by creating the new folder structure and moving files:

---

```bash
mkdir -p lib/screens/RGLight
```

```
mehrozsheikh@Mehrozs-MacBook-Pro squid_game_flutter % 

```

---

```bash
mkdir -p lib/game/RGLight
```

```
mehrozsheikh@Mehrozs-MacBook-Pro squid_game_flutter % 

```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! Now I have created the new folder structure. Now I need to:

1. Move the screen files to `lib/screens/RGLight/`
2. Move the game files to `lib/game/RGLight/` and rename the main game file
3. Rename the main game class from `RedLightGreenLightGame` to `RGLightGame`
4. Update all imports in the affected files

Let me start by moving the screen files:</details></think>

---

Now I'll move all the screen files to the new RGLight folder and move the game files:

---

```bash
mv lib/screens/start_screen.dart lib/screens/RGLight/
```

```
mehrozsheikh@Mehrozs-MacBook-Pro squid_game_flutter % 

```

---

```bash
mv lib/screens/game_over_screen.dart lib/screens/RGLight/

```

```

```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to move the game files to the RGLight folder and rename the main game file:</details></think>

---

Now I'll move the game files to the RGLight folder and rename the main game file:

---

```bash
mv lib/game/game_controller.dart lib/game/RGLight/
```

```
mehrozsheikh@Mehrozs-MacBook-Pro squid_game_flutter % 

```

```

```
mehrozsheikh@Mehrozs-MacBook-Pro squid_game_flutter % 

```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! Now I need to update the main game file to rename the class from `RedLightGreenLightGame` to `RGLightGame` and update all the imports. Let me start by editing the main game file:</details></think>

---

Now I need to rename the classes and update all the imports. Let me start by updating the main game file:

      with TickerProviderStateMixin {
    late GameController _gameController;
```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>



Great! Now I need to update the screen files to fix their imports. The screen files will now be in `lib/screens/RGLight/` and they need to reference the constants from `../../constants/` instead of `../constants/`. Let me also need to update the `squid_game_app.dart` file to import the new game class. Let me do these updates:</details></think>

---

Now I need to update the screen files to fix their import paths since they moved to the RGLight folder:

---

```diff
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
- import 'package:squid_game_flutter/constants/text_styles.dart';
+ import '../../constants/text_styles.dart';
  
  class StartScreen extends StatelessWidget {
```

---

Read file: lib/screens/RGLight/game_over_screen.dart

---

Read file: lib/screens/RGLight/win_screen.dart

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I see that both game_over_screen.dart and win_screen.dart are using absolute imports like `import 'package:squid_game_flutter/constants/text_styles.dart';`. I need to update these to use relative imports. Let me also check the splash_screen to see if it has similar imports.</details></think>

---

```diff
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
- import 'package:squid_game_flutter/constants/text_styles.dart';

  class WinScreen extends StatelessWidget {
```

---

Read file: lib/screens/RGLight/splash_screen.dart

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, the splash_screen.dart file doesn't have any absolute imports that need to be fixed. Now I need to update the main files that reference the game class. Let me check squid_game_app.dart and update it to import the new RGLightGame class:</details></think>

---

Read file: lib/squid_game_app.dart

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>



I see that the squid_game_app.dart file is using absolute imports (package imports) and still references the old class name `RedLightGreenLightGame`. I need to update this to use the new class name `RGLightGame` and fix the imports to use relative imports:</details></think>

---

```diff
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
- import 'package:squid_game_flutter/game/RGLight/rg_light_game.dart';
- import 'package:squid_game_flutter/screens/RGLight/splash_screen.dart';
+ import 'game/RGLight/rg_light_game.dart';
+ import 'screens/RGLight/splash_screen.dart';
  
  class SquidGameApp extends StatefulWidget {
```

```diff
      return _showSplash
          ? SplashScreen(onSplashComplete: _onSplashComplete)
-         : const RedLightGreenLightGame();
+         : const RGLightGame();
    }
  }
```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>



Now I need to check if there are any other files that might be importing or referencing the old game class. Let me check the widget files to see if they have any imports that need to be updated, and also check if the game_controller.dart file has any imports that need to be fixed:</details></think>

Let me check if there are any other files that need to be updated by looking at the game_controller.dart file and checking for any other references:
