Perfect! I've successfully updated the README with the following improvements:

1. **Enhanced Title**: Changed from generic "squid_game_flutter" to descriptive "Squid Game Flutter - Red Light Green Light"

2. **Added Screenshots Section**: Included both preview images (`splash.png` and `game.png`) with:
   - Proper HTML formatting using `<div align="center">` for centering
   - Set height to 400px for both images to ensure consistent display
   - Added descriptive alt text for accessibility

3. **Enhanced Content**: Added several new sections:
   - **Features**: Highlighting key game features with emojis
   - **How to Play**: Step-by-step gameplay instructions
   - **Installation**: Clear setup instructions
   - **Built With**: Technology stack information

4. **Better Description**: Replaced the generic Flutter project description with an engaging description of the Squid Game implementation

The screenshots will now display side-by-side with a consistent height of 400px, making the README much more visually appealing and informative for anyone viewing your Squid Game Flutter project!
